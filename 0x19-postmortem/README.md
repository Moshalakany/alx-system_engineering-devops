#  Postmortem Task


# Issue Summary

**Duration**: April 14, 2024, 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.  
**Service**: E-commerce site  
**Impact**: Total website failure affecting all services, including product listing, shopping cart, and checkout. Approximately 80% of users were affected.

## Root Cause

A memory leak in the web application server caused it to become overloaded and unresponsive.

## Timeline

- **2:30 PM**: Issue detected by monitoring system, alert sent to operations team.
- **2:35 PM**: Web application server restart attempted but unsuccessful.
- **2:40 PM**: Investigation initiated, focusing on server configuration.
- **3:00 PM**: Abnormally high memory usage observed, suspicion of memory leak.
- **3:15 PM**: Code inspection for potential memory leak causes.
- **3:45 PM**: Memory leak identified in code, fix development begins.
- **4:30 PM**: Fix deployed, web application server restarted.
- **4:45 PM**: Website restored to full functionality.

## Detection

Issue detected via monitoring system alert.

## Actions Taken

- Investigation focused on server configuration initially.
- Shifted focus to code inspection upon discovering memory usage anomaly.

## Misleading Paths

Initial assumption of server configuration issue delayed identification of true cause.

## Incident Escalation

Operations team handled initially, escalated to development team upon identifying code issue.

## Resolution

Memory leak in code fixed, including optimization and implementation of memory management best practices. Server restarted after patch deployment.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Regular code reviews to identify memory leaks.
- Enhanced testing procedures to catch leaks pre-production.
- Improved server performance monitoring.
- Documentation and training for operations team.

### Specific Tasks

- Conduct comprehensive code review.
- Implement additional automated tests.
- Update monitoring tools for granular resource usage.
- Provide additional troubleshooting training for operations team.
